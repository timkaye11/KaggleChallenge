KaggleChallenge
===============

Code for a Kaggle project that determined who will default on their respective home mortgage loan. The code for this can be found in kaggle.r

The folder also contains a report that I wrote about Self-Organizing Maps for a Computational Stats course I took during the Fall of 2013 at Pomona College.
